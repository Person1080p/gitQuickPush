# gitQuickPush
automatically runs git add./, commit "shell arguemt", push in 1 easy script. Mostly good if only working on master branch or as a single person

name of file is gitq.sh
probably a decent idea to add it to ur path or /usr/bin/gitq.sh
#
quick n dirty way to run it anywhere is do "alias /home/whateverFileThisIsIn/gitq.sh"
